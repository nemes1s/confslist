JavaZone – the biggest European community-driven conference for modern developers will be 20 years old in 2021! Don’t miss out on two days of inspiring tech talks, a day of hands-on sessions, mingling, and a great party!

JavaZone is organized by javaBin, the Norwegian Java User Group. Our goal is to organize a community-driven conference for Java developers where they can learn new things, share knowledge, and socialize.

We have been organizing JavaZone since 2001 and have been excited to watch the event grow bigger and better every year. In 2019 we hosted over 3200 participants and 160 speakers across 7 parallel tracks over the course of two days. In addition, we also offered a selection of 11 workshops held on the day before the conference started.

In 2020 due to COVID-19 we had our first free virtual conference, with 4 parallal tracks. This year we are back to a physical conference at Oslo spektrum december 8-9th.
