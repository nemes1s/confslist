Ref talk description: Too often we encounter the idea that software architecture is an esoteric concept, of which only the chosen ones, and at the right time, are allowed to discuss. Well, how about a little change of perspective?

With software development and users’ needs evolving so fast, we don’t afford the luxury of rewriting systems from scratch just because teams fail to understand what they are building. Today’s software developers are tomorrow’s architects. We must challenge them to step away from the IDE and understand how the architecture evolves in order to create a common and stable ground in terms of quality, performance, reliability, and scalability. At the same time, software architects need to step away from the abstractions and stay updated to the project development reality.
